            What is Meenakari Jewellery?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Meenakari (also spelled Minakari) is one of India's most ancient and
            celebrated jewellery-making art forms, with its roots deeply
            embedded in Jaipur, Rajasthan. The word "meen" derives from the
            Persian word for fish and is associated with colour. Meenakari
            involves the application of vibrant enamel colours to gold or
            gold-plated metal surfaces through a meticulous heating process, in
            which the enamel fuses with the metal to create stunning, permanent
            patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jaipur's meenakari tradition dates to the 16th century when Raja Man
            Singh I of Amber brought skilled Persian and Lahori artisans to the
            region. Over centuries, local artisans developed the distinctive
            Jaipur style — characterized by use of gold as the base metal,
            vibrant colour palettes including deep reds, forest greens, and
            cobalt blues, and intricate floral and peacock patterns. Jaipur
            meenakari is unique in its double-sided technique, where both faces
            of the jewellery are adorned.
