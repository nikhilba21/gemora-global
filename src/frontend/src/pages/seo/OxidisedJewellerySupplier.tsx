            Why Choose Gemora Global as Your Oxidised Jewellery Supplier?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sourcing oxidised jewellery wholesale requires a supplier who
            understands the nuances of oxidised finishing — the right depth of
            oxidation, consistent quality across batches, and finishing that
            neither flakes nor over-oxidises during wear. As an experienced
            oxidised jewellery manufacturer and supplier, Gemora Global has
            perfected our oxidised finishing process over years of production.

        {
          q: "How is oxidised jewellery different from regular silver jewellery?",
          a: "Regular silver jewellery aims for a bright, polished finish. Oxidised jewellery intentionally darkens the metal with a chemical treatment to create an antique, aged appearance. It is typically made with base metal (brass/copper) rather than real silver.",
        },
        {
          q: "Does oxidised jewellery tarnish further over time?",
          a: "Quality oxidised jewellery with protective coating maintains its finish. The initial oxidation is stable. However, prolonged exposure to moisture and chemicals can affect the finish. We apply protective coatings to extend the finish life.",
        },
        {
          q: "Can I get oxidised jewellery with custom designs?",
          a: "Yes, we manufacture custom oxidised jewellery designs for exclusive collections. Custom orders require a minimum of 100 units per design and 15–20 business days for production.",
        },
        {
          q: "Is there a difference between oxidised and antique jewellery?",
          a: "The terms are used interchangeably in the imitation jewellery trade. Both describe dark-finish metal jewellery with an aged appearance. Some suppliers use 'antique gold' for a brownish-gold oxidised look and 'oxidised silver' for the black-silver finish.",
        },
        {
          q: "Do you sell oxidised jewellery wholesale internationally?",
          a: "Yes, we export oxidised jewellery wholesale to UK, USA, UAE, Germany, France, Australia, and other countries. See our international pages for country-specific shipping information.",
