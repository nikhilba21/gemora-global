            What is Kundan Jewellery?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Kundan jewellery is a traditional Indian jewellery-making art form
            originating from the royal courts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It
            involves setting uncut gemstones (real or synthetic) within gold
            foil-backed frames, creating jewellery of extraordinary visual
            richness. Jaipur — where Gemora Global is based — is the global
            capital of kundan jewellery manufacturing, making us uniquely
            positioned to supply authentic and high-quality kundan pieces at
            wholesale prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our kundan jewellery wholesale range covers necklace sets, earrings,
            maang tikkas, haath phools, bangles, and complete bridal kundan
            jewellery sets. Each piece is crafted by skilled artisans with
            multi-generation expertise in kundan work, ensuring quality that
            meets international retail standards.
