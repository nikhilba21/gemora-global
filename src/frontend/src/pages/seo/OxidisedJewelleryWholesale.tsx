            What is Oxidised Jewellery?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Oxidised jewellery features a distinctive antique silver-black
            finish created by treating silver or silver-plated metal with
            chemicals to create a darkened, aged appearance. This rustic,
            boho-ethnic aesthetic has made oxidised jewellery one of the most
            popular categories in global fashion markets, appealing to buyers
            who prefer earthy, artisanal styles over shiny gold-finish pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jaipur, where Gemora Global is based, has a centuries-old tradition
            of oxidised silver jewellery making. Our artisans combine
            traditional techniques with modern designs to create oxidised
            jewellery wholesale collections that sell strongly in both domestic
            and international markets.
