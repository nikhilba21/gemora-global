            India's Trusted Bulk Jewellery Supplier
          </h2>
          <p>
            Gemora Global is a leading bulk jewellery supplier from India,
            providing wholesale fashion jewellery to resellers, boutiques,
            market traders, online retailers, and distributors across 15+
            countries. Our bulk supply model is built around reliability —
            consistent quality, consistent pricing, and consistent availability
            that allows your business to grow without supply chain surprises.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a direct manufacturer and bulk jewellery supplier, we offer
            pricing that is significantly more competitive than sourcing through
            traders, agents, or wholesale aggregator platforms. Our direct
            factory pricing, combined with our anti-tarnish quality standard,
            delivers a product that performs better at retail while costing less
            at wholesale — the optimal combination for resellers focused on
            margin.

            Bulk Order Benefits & Volume Pricing
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our bulk supply programme offers tiered pricing that rewards growing
            order volumes. At 50 units per design (standard MOQ), buyers access
            our base wholesale price. At 200+ units per design, a 5–10% volume
            discount applies. At 500+ units per design, our best bulk wholesale
            rate is available. For orders of 1,000+ units per design, bespoke
            pricing can be negotiated based on the full order value and buyer
            relationship history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bulk orders receive priority dispatch scheduling — your order queue
            position is prioritised over smaller orders during busy periods,
            ensuring your stock arrives when your business needs it. We also
            offer reserved stock arrangements for high-volume regular buyers —
            contact us to discuss a reserved stock programme for your most
            critical selling lines.

            For Jewellery Resellers & Boutique Buyers
          </h2>
          <p>
            Jewellery resellers sourcing bulk fashion jewellery for resellers
            need a supplier that understands their business model — fast-moving
            inventory, competitive buy prices, consistent quality, and the
            ability to reorder popular designs quickly. Gemora Global is built
            for this. Our reorder process is straightforward: select the designs
            you want to repeat, confirm quantity and payment, and receive
            dispatch within 7–10 business days.
          </p>
          <p>
            For boutique buyers, we offer a jewellery supplier for boutiques
            service that includes seasonal buying guidance — our sales team can
            advise on which designs are performing strongly in your market, what
            new arrivals are trending, and what complementary categories can
            round out your boutique's offering. We treat our boutique buyers as
            long-term partners, not one-off transactions.

            Dropshipping Jewellery from India
          </h2>
          <p>
            For online jewellery businesses exploring dropshipping, Gemora
            Global offers a dropshipping-compatible supply model. While we do
            not operate a traditional dropship-per-order service, we can supply
            bulk stock to your warehouse or fulfillment centre with fast
            replenishment cycles. Contact us to discuss how our supply model can
            support your e-commerce jewellery business.
