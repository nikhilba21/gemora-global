            Why Jaipur is India's Imitation Jewellery Capital
          </h2>
          <p>
            Jaipur — the Pink City of Rajasthan — has been India's foremost
            jewellery manufacturing hub for over 500 years. The city's artisan
            tradition covers every jewellery-making technique: kundan stone
            setting, meenakari enamel work, lac jewellery, oxidised silver
            finishing, and precision casting. No other city in India rivals
            Jaipur's combination of skilled manpower, complete supply chain, and
            export infrastructure for imitation jewellery manufacturing.

            <li>
              <strong>Anti-tarnish guarantee:</strong> Every piece is finished
              with our proprietary multi-layer anti-tarnish coating, giving
              retailers and their customers a superior experience compared to
              standard plated jewellery.

            <li>
              <strong>Consistent plating thickness:</strong> Our electroplating
              unit maintains minimum 2-micron gold plating across all pieces,
              reducing the tarnishing and discolouration common in cheap
              jewellery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stone security:</strong> Each set stone is tested for
              secure setting before dispatch — no loose or missing stones on
              arrival.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Export-grade packaging:</strong> Velvet-lined individual
