            Why UK Buyers Source Wholesale Jewellery from India
          </h2>
          <p>
            The United Kingdom has one of the world's largest and most affluent
            South Asian diaspora communities, creating consistent year-round
            demand for authentic Indian jewellery — particularly bridal,
            festive, and occasion-wear styles. UK boutiques, wedding retailers,
            and online sellers consistently source wholesale jewellery from
            Indian manufacturers for several compelling reasons:

            <li>
